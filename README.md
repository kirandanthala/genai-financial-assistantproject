# GenAI-Powered Financial Insights Assistant  

## 🎯 Objective  
A GenAI-powered assistant that provides personalized financial insights based on user queries and transaction data.  
- Accepts natural language queries (e.g., *“How much did I spend on groceries last month?”*)  
- Analyzes structured transaction data (`transactions.csv`)  
- Uses **Azure OpenAI (GPT deployment)** to generate financial summaries  
- Provides actionable insights (spending trends, saving tips)  
- Accessible via a simple **web interface** (`/ask-ui`)

 Learnings and Challenges

Learned how to integrate Flask with Azure OpenAI.

Understood environment variable handling to protect secrets.

Faced issues with deployment (Application Error, 405 Method Not Allowed) and fixed them.

Implemented dynamic category detection → now app works with any category in transactions.csv.

Learned Agile practices → writing User Stories (3C) and Test Cases (with actual results).
