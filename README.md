# GenAI-Powered Financial Insights Assistant

## üìå Project Overview
This project is a **GenAI-powered assistant** that provides personalized financial insights using natural language queries and structured transaction data.  
It is built with **Flask**, **Azure OpenAI**, and **pandas**.  

The assistant can:
- Accept natural language queries (e.g., "How much did I spend on groceries last month?")  
- Analyze structured transaction data (CSV file)  
- Provide actionable insights such as spending summaries, top expense categories, and trends  
- Be accessed through a simple REST API
